# C Homework Collection Solutions
Hello! This is a sandbox repository which I hope would be useful as a code reference for beginner coders. I will add solutions to the problems in the provided c-homework-collection.pdf file from time to time, using different programming languages, maybe. It may contain bad, missing, stupid code so be warned!
