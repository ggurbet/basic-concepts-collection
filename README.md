# C Homework Collection Solutions
Hello! This is a sandbox repository which I hope would be useful as a code reference for beginner coders. I will add solutions to the problems to the [C Homework Collection](http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/course/view.php?id=141) from time to time, using different programming languages. It may contain bad, missing, stupid code so be warned!
